⚠️ Important: This portfolio is built as a dual-persona template (Developer & Designer) and includes placeholder content, images, and structure tailored to the original creator.

To personalize it for yourself, you’ll need to:

Replace profile images in /public/assets/ (devPP.png, designerPP.png, etc.)

Modify the content inside the /src/data/ JSON files

Update any text, contact details, or branding visuals in the components as needed.

The JSON-driven structure makes it easy to plug in your own details without deep diving into the code logic.
